<body>
<p>My name is Gillian Follett and I'm a sophomore majoring in Newspaper and Online Journalism and Information Management and Technology at Syracuse University. I'm twenty years old. I'm from Belchertown, Massachusetts, and I'm one of four siblings. At home, I have three dogs and seven cats.</p>
<p>I'm very involved on campus at SU. I'm an assistant copy editor at The Daily Orange; the philanthropy chair of Kappa Theta Pi, a national professional technology fraternity; and the website coordinator for Women in Communications. I love each of these roles, and they are a great compliment to the skills I'm learning in my classes. I have always been very passionate about writing and reporting, and the opportunity to work on these skills in a real-world setting has been incredible. In the future, I hope to become an investigative reporter and travel the world reporting on important stories around the globe.</p>
